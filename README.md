## Author: Alistair Blake

### Challenge:

* Created a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
* Created a BinaryTree class
Defined a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

* Created a BinarySearchTree class
Defined a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Defined a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

### Approach & Efficiency:
What approach did you take? Why? 
Big(O)
* Space:
* Time:

### Testing
Write tests to prove the following functionality:

1. Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
2. Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
3. Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
4. Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
5. Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
6. Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal

### API:

<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees
